 Random Quote Generator

In this project I created an app that displays a random quote from a small selection of my own whenever the page is refreshed or the button is clicked.

Quote objects include quote text, source, citation, and year. In addition, several quotes include series: indicating which book they're from in a larger trilogy. 

Background color is randomized, and the color and quote change automatically every 25 seconds to accomodate for some of the longer quotes.
